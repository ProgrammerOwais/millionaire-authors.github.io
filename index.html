                    K Rowling was born in the United Kingdom on July 31 1965.
                    Her real name is Joanne Rowling but changed it to JK Rowling
                    to write the Harry Potter book series so that boys might like
                    it too. If boys thought the author was a girl then they might
                    not read it.  The first Harry Potter book was <strong>published in 1997</strong>.
                    One thing I love about JK Rowling is that she never gave up on 
                    making the Harry Potter book series because she got turned down
                    by 12 book publishers until Bloomsbury published her first book.
                    JK Rowling became the 9th best selling fictional author in world.

                 and movies, JK Rowlings created a charity called <strong>Lumos.  Lumos</strong> is
                 fundraiser for kids with no parents or kids with disabilities.  JK
                 Rowling also gave money and support to help fight multiple sclerosis

                      I grew up in Chicago and was a porky kid with few friends.
                      I wasn’t interested in teenage girls or playing sports 
                      but donuts, video games, and bowling.  My exertions at 
                      the time were epitomized by a long broken broomstick;  When I did move, the local 
                      ice cream shop was often my target; a sugary delight was  a motive I could always count on
                      “Excuse me sir?” I nervously muttered hoping he wouldn’t ignore me. 
                      “May I ask what you do for a living that allows you to afford such 
                      an awesome car?” Sensing relief that I wasn’t a teenage derelict, 
                      the owner kindly responded: <strong>“I’m an inventor.”</strong> Perplexed that his 
                      answer didn’t match my preconception; my prepared follow-up questions 
                      were nullified, paralyzing my next move.
